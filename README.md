## About The Project
The goal of this project is to practice white box testing on a real world web application. You will utilize Python and
Selenium to practice testing on both frontend and backend on a website and the APIs developed by YuRide.
YuRide is a Ride-Sharing service founded by YorkU Alumni. They allow us to perform testing on their source code and
web app in order to help you see a real world example and apply your knowldege that you have gained in this course on
a real project.
This project consists of 3 parts, and you will write tests cases using the tools outlined below. You must follow good
coding practice and design in order to achieve good grades for this project:
• Good test cases are essential for a robust software, and you must write these test cases to cover all the required
aspects.
• Test cases should be well-defined, desireably with no duplication, and cover all the edge cases.
• Documentation principle: Try to write the tests so that it includes all the elements needed to understand the
technique(s) that you are using



### Built With:

Selenium


### Automation with Selenium: 
TODO
==Start a new script named test_ui.py, use the same unittest class, test format in the previous challenge, and Import
selenium libraries including webdriver.==
In the Unit Test class, leverage Selenium to achieve the following functionality:
1. Use Selenium to navigate to https://dev.yuride.network
2. Verify the website title is `Your Website
3. Make Selenium click the Sign In button on the left
4. Wait until Passport York Login page is loaded
5. Use Selenium to enter your own Passport York credentials and login
6. Click the Send Me a Push button
7. Wait until you manually confirm the login request on your device
8. Wait until the login redirect OR click the redirect link
9. Verify in the body, there's the H1 element with content DASHBOARD (successfully logged in)
