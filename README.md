## About The Project
The goal of this project is to practice white box testing on a real world web application. You will utilize Python and
Selenium to practice testing on both frontend and backend on a website and the APIs developed by YuRide.
YuRide is a Ride-Sharing service founded by YorkU Alumni. They allow us to perform testing on their source code and
web app in order to help you see a real world example and apply your knowldege that you have gained in this course on
a real project.
This project consists of 3 parts, and you will write tests cases using the tools outlined below. You must follow good
coding practice and design in order to achieve good grades for this project:
• Good test cases are essential for a robust software, and you must write these test cases to cover all the required
aspects.
• Test cases should be well-defined, desireably with no duplication, and cover all the edge cases.
• Documentation principle: Try to write the tests so that it includes all the elements needed to understand the
technique(s) that you are using
